# **App Name**: Next Blank Slate

## Core Features:

- Project Setup: Configure a new Next.js project using the app router, without additional packages, and the public directory.
- Page Rendering: Render a default home page (`app/page.js`) with basic content, such as the project name, and a brief description of how to proceed with configuring the project.
- Directory Configuration: Create a 'public' directory in the project root, pre-configured for static assets. Make sure that images in the 'public' directory are automatically served by Nextjs

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB), reminiscent of a fresh start, provides a calming and open feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), offers a clean, unobtrusive backdrop, ideal for showcasing a range of content without distraction.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B), representing potential and quality, draws attention to key areas and complements the blue with warmth.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. It provides a clean and readable experience for all types of content.
- Use a clean, minimalist layout with ample white space to emphasize clarity and focus. The structure should be simple and intuitive to guide new developers.
